  - [ ] Test: Normal paths still accepted
- **Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
- **Reviewer Sign-off:** ___________

### [ ] 8. Non-Atomic File Encryption
- **File:** vault_security.c
- **Lines:** 1360-1385 (cmd_encrypt_vault)
- **Issue:** File deleted after partial encryption = data loss
- **Patch Source:** SECURITY_PATCHES.c - PATCH 6

- [ ] Test with 1000+ files in vault
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during operation
- [ ] Check for memory leaks: `valgrind --leak-check=full ...`
